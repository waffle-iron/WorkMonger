This sample project illustrates isomorphic (universal) rendering using React and Webpack.

Features

* React
* React-router
* Redux
* Isomorphic (universal) rendering
* Webpack 2
* Development mode: hot reload for React components, hot reload for Redux reducers and actions

Quick Start
===========

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* wait for it to finish (it will say "Now go to http://127.0.0.1:3000" in the end)
* go to `http://localhost:3000`
* interact with the development version of the web application
* `Ctrl + C`
* `npm run production`
* wait a bit for Webpack to finish the build (green stats will appear in the terminal, plus some `node.js` server running commands)
* go to `http://localhost:3000`
* interact with the production version of the web application

Summary
=======

This application consists of the "client side" and the "server side".

The "client side" (`./client`) is the javascript code (`./client/application.js`) which is built by Webpack and is run in a user's web browser, along with the "page rendering service" (`./client/rendering-service`) which does the same thing but in a Node.js process on the server (but is still considered more "client-side" than "server-side").

The "server side" consists of the "API service" (`./api`) and the "proxy service" (`./webserver`) which runs on port `3000` and routes various URL paths to their respective destinations:

* "statics" ("static files", "assets") are served (in production mode only) on `/assets` URL path
* `/api` is proxied to the "API service" (running on port `3003`)
* all the other URLs are proxied to the "page rendering service" (which runs on port `3002`).

In development mode there's one more Node.js process running: it's `webpack-dev-server` running on port `3001` which serves the "assets" compiled by Webpack (live) via HTTP protocol. In production there's no `webpack-dev-server` and Webpack just outputs those compiled assets to the `./client/build` folder and the "proxy service" (`./webserver`) serves those "assets" from there. In a real production environment though this "hand made" sample proxy service should be dropped in favour of a proper proxy like NginX or HAProxy. Or a developer could rather use no proxy at all hosting everything completely separately in the cloud (the modern way). So this "proxied" setup is here just for simplicity and illustration purpose.
